Spring Security Role Generator
==============================

This plugin facilitates easier implementation of the spring security core plugin's annotated controllers.
It does this in two ways:

1.  It provides a controller template that can be used during scaffolding.
    This controller comes preconfigured with CREATE VIEW EDIT and DELETE annotations for the given class.

2.  To tie into the controller above a generate-roles script is provided that will generate the
    statements to create the roles for each class.

    For each class supplied it will generate a CREATE, VIEW, EDIT and DELETE role.
    You can generate for all classes by passing "*" as the parameter following the grails convention.

        generate-roles "*"
        generate-roles com.sample.MyClass

    You can then take the generated statements and add it to your bootstrap for example.
